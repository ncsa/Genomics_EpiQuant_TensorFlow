# SEMS-TensorFlow

SEMS-Tensorflow is a program developed at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications in collaboration with the Center for
Computational Biotechnology and Genomic Medicine to map epistatic gene
interactions. It uses a two layered neural network to perform massively
parallel linear regression. It traverses the multidimensional space using
gradient descent optimization with L2 regularization.

# Usage
